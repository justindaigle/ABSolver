# ABSolver
A solver for the game Alphabear, written in Ruby. It expects a dictionary to be in the script's directory, named words.txt. I don't think I'm allowed to redistribute them, but one like this should work:

It will ask for the letters available to you. If, for instance, you have C, F, E, R, N, and A, give it CFERNA and hit enter.
I wouldn't use it on timed game modes, even though it runs pretty fast for me. ;)
